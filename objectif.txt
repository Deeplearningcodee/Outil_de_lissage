Overall Goal:

The script simulates an "Global Optimization" process. For a list of products, it tries to find the best "multiplicative factors" (J, K, L) to apply to a base command quantity. The goal is to make the final "Optimized Command" for each product result in a "Difference" (between a target stock level and the effects of the command) as close to zero as possible. This is done while respecting various constraints and user-defined limits.

Key Sheets and Concepts (from your VBA description, mirrored in Python):

Feuil8 (Optimization Sheet - simulated by Python data structures):

Parameter Row (e.g., row 4 in Excel): Contains the J, K, L factors, a "Boost PDC" (H_param), and min/max limits (O,P,Q,S,T,U) for the J,K,L factors. The Python code stores these in a dictionary like product_params.

Simulation/Data Row (e.g., row 18 in Excel): Contains product-specific data like "PDC stock cible" (target stock), "En-cours" (stock already ordered), "Commande SM à 100%" (base command). Formulas here calculate "Différence PDC / Commande," "Différence absolue" (the value to minimize), etc. The Python code stores these in product_data_sim.

Décalage (Offset): The parameters on row idx_param affect the calculations on row idx_param + 14. This is implicitly handled by how product_params and product_data_sim are used together.

Feuil13 (Macro Parameters Sheet - simulated by global Python constants):

Contains global margins and thresholds (e.g., MARGE_MANOEUVRE_BOOST, MARGE_UVC_SOLVER).

Main Python Functions and Their Roles (Simulating VBA Macros):

recalculate(product_data, params_jklh):

Purpose: This is the heart of the calculation engine, simulating how Excel recalculates cells when input values change.

Inputs:

product_data: Data for the specific product (target stock E_data_sim, on-order stock G_data_sim, base command N_data_sim, product category top_category_sim).

params_jklh: Current optimization parameters (factors J_param, K_param, L_param, and H_param for Boost PDC).

Actions:

Calculates E_ajuste_sim (Adjusted Target Stock) by applying the H_param (Boost PDC) to E_data_sim.

Selects the correct factor (J_param, K_param, or L_param) based on the product's top_category_sim ("Top 500", "Top 3000", or "Autre").

Calculates F_sim (Optimized Command) by multiplying N_data_sim (Base Command) by the chosen factor.

Calculates H_sim (Difference PDC / Command): E_ajuste_sim - G_data_sim - F_sim.

Calculates I_sim (Absolute Difference): abs(H_sim). This is the value the optimizer tries to minimize.

Calculates K_sim (Relative Variation PDC): H_sim / E_data_sim.

Calculates L_sim (Absolute Relative Variation PDC): abs(K_sim).

Output: A dictionary containing these calculated values (H_sim, I_sim, K_sim, L_sim, F_sim).

limite_haute_basse(product_params, product_data_sim):

Purpose: Simulates the Limite_Haute_Basse VBA macro. Initializes parameters and applies an initial "Boost PDC" if needed.

Actions:

Initialization:

Sets default min/max limits for the J,K,L factors (O_param, P_param, Q_param, S_param, T_param, U_param) to 1.0 (100%) if they are not already provided in product_params. This allows user-defined limits to be used.

Sets initial J,K,L factors to 1.0 (100%).

Sets initial "Boost PDC" (H_param) to 0%.

First recalculate(): Calls recalculate() to get initial difference and variation values.

Boost PDC Decision:

If the K_sim (Relative Variation PDC) is too high (greater than MARGE_MANOEUVRE_BOOST), it applies a negative H_param (e.g., -5%) to try and reduce the target stock.

If K_sim is too low (less than -MARGE_MANOEUVRE_BOOST), it applies a positive H_param.

Second recalculate(): Calls recalculate() again with the (potentially new) H_param.

Output: The results from the second recalculate().

optimisation_macro(product_params, product_data_sim, sim_results_after_lhb):

Purpose: Simulates the Optimisation VBA macro. Decides if the main "Solver" (optimizer) needs to be called.

Actions:

Determine TypeLissage (Smoothing Type: "Hausse" (Increase) or "Baisse" (Decrease)):

If O_param * P_param * Q_param >= 1.0, TypeLissage = 1 (Hausse). This means the lower limits for J,K,L don't force a decrease.

Otherwise, TypeLissage = 0 (Baisse).

Check User Min/Max Factor Limits (F_param_borne_min, G_param_borne_max):

If these general min/max limits (provided by the user for the JKL factors) are identical:

Set J,K,L factors to this fixed value (respecting the specific O,S,P,T,Q,U limits).

No Solver is needed.

Else (Min != Max):

Test with Max User Limit: Temporarily set J,K,L to G_param_borne_max (the user's maximum allowed factor, again capped by O,S,P,T,Q,U).

Call recalculate() to see the result.

Solver Decision: If the I_sim (Absolute Difference) and L_sim (Absolute Relative Variation PDC) are still too large (above MARGE_I_SOLVER and MARGE_UVC_SOLVER respectively), then the Solver is needed.

If the test values are good enough, the Solver is not called, and J,K,L remain at these test values.

If the Solver is called, J,K,L are reset to their state after limite_haute_basse (typically 1.0) so the solver starts from a neutral point.

Output: A boolean (call_solver) and the latest simulation results.

objective_function_solver(factors_jkl_array) (for differential_evolution):

Purpose: This is the function that the differential_evolution optimizer tries to minimize.

Input: factors_jkl_array (an array containing the current trial values for J, K, L, or just J if TypeLissage=1).

Actions:

Retrieves the global current_product_state_for_solver (which holds product_data_sim and product_params like H_param).

Updates temporary J,K,L parameters based on factors_jkl_array and TypeLissage:

If TypeLissage = 1 (Hausse): K_param = J_param, L_param = J_param.

If TypeLissage = 0 (Baisse): J, K, L are taken directly from factors_jkl_array.

Calls recalculate() with these temporary J,K,L and the current H_param.

Output: Returns the I_sim (Absolute Difference) from the recalculation. differential_evolution will try to find J,K,L values that make this I_sim as small as possible.

solver_macro(product_params, product_data_sim):

Purpose: Simulates the Solveur VBA macro. Performs the detailed optimization using Scipy's optimization functions.

Actions:

Sets up current_product_state_for_solver for the objective_function_solver.

Handles TypeLissage = 1 (Hausse - one variable J, K=J, L=J):

Uses scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar because it's efficient for single-variable bounded optimization.

Defines a local objective_for_minimize_scalar function that only takes j_val.

Calls minimize_scalar with bounds for J (O_param, S_param).

Updates J_param, K_param, L_param with the result.

Handles TypeLissage = 0 (Baisse - three variables J,K,L):

Uses scipy.optimize.differential_evolution (a global optimizer good for more complex problems).

Sets up bounds for J, K, and L using O,S, P,T, Q,U.

Sets up a NonlinearConstraint to enforce J >= K >= L.

Calls differential_evolution with the objective_function_solver.

Updates J_param, K_param, L_param with the results.

Second Run (for differential_evolution): If I_sim is still too high after the first run, it performs a second, longer run of differential_evolution starting from the previous best result.

Calls recalculate() one last time with the final optimized J,K,L factors.

Output: The final simulation results after optimization.

Data Structures:

produits_a_optimiser (List of Dictionaries):

Each dictionary represents a product to be optimized.

Contains a params sub-dictionary (for F_param_borne_min, G_param_borne_max, and user-defined O,P,Q,S,T,U limits for the solver).

Contains a data_sim sub-dictionary (for product-specific data like E_data_sim, G_data_sim, N_data_sim, top_category_sim).

Execution Flow (in the if __name__ == "__main__": block):

Prints a start message.

Loops through each produit_config in produits_a_optimiser.

For each product:

Calls limite_haute_basse() to initialize and get initial results.

Calls optimisation_macro() to decide if the solver is needed and get results from testing the max user limit.

If call_solver is true:

Calls solver_macro() to perform the detailed optimization.

Stores the final J,K,L factors, H_boost, and final simulation metrics (F_optimisee, I_final, L_var_abs_pdc_final).

Prints a summary for the processed product.

After processing all products, prints a final summary of J,K,L factors and other key metrics for each product.

In essence, the Python script meticulously replicates the step-by-step logic of your VBA optimization, using Python functions for macros and data structures for Excel sheet data, and leveraging Scipy's optimization algorithms to replace Excel's Solver.
